This module is designed to: 1) pull out all of the two-, three-, and
four-word phrases in a given text, and 2) list these phrases according
to their frequency. Using this module is it possible to create lists of
the most common phrases in a text as well as order them by their
probable occurance, thus implying significance. This process is useful
for the purposes of textual analysis and "distant reading".

The two-word phrases (bi-grams) are also listable by their T-Score. The
T-Score, as well as a number of the module's other methods, is
calculated as per Nugues, P. M. (2006). An introduction to language
processing with Perl and Prolog: An outline of theories, implementation,
and application with special consideration of English, French, and
German. Cognitive technologies. Berlin: Springer.
